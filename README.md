Typically, an MDM system consists of a server or cloud-based platform that interacts with client applications installed on the managed devices. The MDM server allows administrators to remotely configure device settings, enforce security policies (e.g., passcode requirements, encryption), distribute and update applications, and perform actions like device tracking and remote wipe.

Some common features and capabilities of an MDM solution may include:

Device enrollment: Onboarding new devices into the MDM system, often through a registration process.
Configuration management: Remotely configuring device settings, including Wi-Fi, email, VPN, and other profiles.
Security policies: Enforcing security measures such as passcodes, encryption, and restrictions on device features.
Application management: Distributing and managing applications on managed devices, including installation, updates, and removal.
Content management: Controlling access to corporate content, documents, and resources.
Remote management: Performing actions remotely, such as device tracking, locking, wiping, or sending notifications.
Compliance monitoring: Monitoring devices for compliance with organizational policies and generating reports.
Mobile app management: Managing and securing mobile applications, including containerization and app-level policies.
Integration with existing systems: Integrating with other enterprise systems like user directories, email servers, or service desks.
